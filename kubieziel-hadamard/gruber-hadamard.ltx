A Hadamard matrix of order $n$ is an real $n\times n$ matrix $H$ which
satisfies the identity
\begin{gather*}
  HH^{T}= nI
\end{gather*}
An equivalent definition for Hadamard matrices is a square matrix
whose elements come from the set $\{1, -1\}$ and whose rows are all
orthogonal.  These matrices were invented by James Joseph Sylvester in
1867, who called them anallagmatic pavements.  Sylvester also
developed a construction for this type of matrix, which will be shown
later.  Hadamard matrices are often visualized using colored blocks,
where the black blocks represent the ones in the matrix and the white
blocks represent negative ones.  Figure 1 shows an example of a
Hadamard matrix of order 16.

Changing the sign of all entries of a row or column of a Hadamard
matrix will result in another Hadamard matrix.  Similarly, permuting
rows and columns of a Hadamard matrix or transposing the matrix will
result in a Hadamard matrix.  Any Hadamard matrix found through such a
series of transformations considered equivalent to the original
matrix.  Often, Hadamard matrices are normalized, meaning the first
row andcolumn are made to be entirely of
ones\cite{hallm}. This is usually achieved through a
series of sign changes of rows and columns; thus, the normalized
matrix is equivalent to the original.

Whether a Hadamard matrix of a given order exists is, in many cases,
an unsolved problem.  The following theorem, however, gives a
necessary condition for their existence.
\begin{theorem}
  If a Hadamard matrix of order $n$ exists, then $n=1,2$  or
  $n\equiv0\pmod{4}$.
  \begin{proof}
    The following is a proof of this theorem taken from Combinatorial
    Theory by Hall\cite{hallm}.  A Hadamard matrix of order
    $1$ is $(1)$.  For order two, there exists the Hadamard matrix $
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 1\\
      1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}$.  For $n\geq3$, suppose the matrix has been
    normalized so that entire first row is made of ones.  There exist
    four possible combinations of ones and negative ones for the next
    two entries in each column: $(+1,+1)$, $(+1,-1)$, $(-1,+1)$ and
    $(-1,-1)$.  Therefore, arranget he columns so that all columns
    starting with  $(+1,+1,+1)$ are together and those starting with
    $(+1,+1,-1)$  are together and soforth for all four types of
    columns.  The matrix would be in the following form:
    \begin{gather*}
      \begin{pmatrix}
        + & \dots & + & + & \dots & + & + & \dots & + & + & \dots & +\\
        + & \dots & + & + & \dots & + & - & \dots & - & - & \dots & -\\
        + & \dots & + & - & \dots & - & + & \dots & + & - & \dots & -\\
      \end{pmatrix}
    \end{gather*}
    Let $a$ be the number of columns of the first type and let $b$,
    $c$ and $d$ be the numbers of columns of the second third and
    fourth types, respectively.  Then the following equation can be
    written:
    \begin{align*}
      a+b &= c+d= \sfrac{n}{2}\\
      a+c &= b+d= \sfrac{n}{2}\\
      a+d &= b+d= \sfrac{n}{2}\\
    \end{align*}
    Solving this system of equationsleads to $a = b = c = d =
    \sfrac{n}{4}$. Thus, since $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are integers, $n$
    must be amultiple of four.\cite{hallm}
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
Although Sylvester invented matrices of this type, it was actually
Jacques Hadamard for whom these matrices are named.  This is a result
ofthe following theorem by Hadamard.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $X= (x_{ij})$ be a real $n\times n$ matrix whose entries
  satisfy $\abs{a_{ij}}\leq1$ for all $i$ and $j$. Then,
  $\abs{\det{X}}\leq n^{\sfrac{n}{2}}$. Equality holds if and only if
  $X$ is a Hadamard matrix.\cite{cameron1}
  \begin{proof}
    This theorem can be proven using a geometric interpretation of the
    determinant. The following proof is taken from Combinatorics:
    Topics, Techniques, Algorithms by Cameron.\cite{cameron1}
    Viewed geometrically, the determinant of a matrix $X$ is the
    volume of a parallelpiped in the $n$-dimensional Euclidian space
    whose sides are represented by the rows of $X$. Since it was
    assumed that all entries of the matrix were less than or equal to
    one, then the maximum possible Euclidian length of any side is
    $\sqrt{n}$.  The maximum possible volume of the parallelpiped is
    the product of the edge lengths.  The volume is equal to the
    maximum possible volume if and only if the edges are all
    perpendicular to one another.  Thus, the maximum possible volume
    for the parallelpiped, and, in turn, the maximum possible
    determinant of X, is $n^{\sfrac{n}{2}}$.  This maximum value is
    reached only if the length of all sides are $\sqrt{n}$ and the
    sides are mutually perpendicular.  In the matrix $X$, this would
    correspond to all entries being either $\pm1$ and each row of the
    matrix being orthogonal to allothers.  This is equivalent to
    $XX^{T}=nI$.\cite{cameron1}
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

Once Hadamard had proven this theorem, he conjectured that a Hadamard
matrix of order $n$ exists for $n=1,2$ or $n\equiv0\pmod{4}$. This
conjecture is one of the great unsolved problems in mathematics today.
Although it remains unproven, those attempting to prove it have made
many advances in the field of Combinatorics.  Also, there has been
some progress in proving the existence of Hadamard matrices of
specific orders through various constructions and computer
searches. Most recently, in 2004, Hadi Kharaghani and Behruz
Tayfeh-Rezaie found a Hadamard matrix of order
428.\cite{kharaghani} Currently, the smallest factor of four
for which there exists no known Hadamard matrix is 668.

\section{Constructions of Hadamard Matrices}
\label{sec:const}

As mentioned previously, many Hadamard matrices can be formed using
various constructions.  Some of the earliest and most famous
constructions are those by Sylvester, Paley and Williamson, but others
do exist.  The first construction of Hadamard matrices was found by
their inventor, James Joseph Sylvester, in 1867.  He used the
Kronecker product ortens or product to find new Hadamard matrices from
old ones.\cite{cameron2} By this construction, he was able
to show that a Hadamard matrix exists for all .

In general, if $A=(a_{ij})$ is an $m\times n$ matrix and $B= (b_{kl})$
is an $p\times q$ matrix, then their Kronecker product $A\otimes B$ is
the $mp\times nq$ matrix made up of $p\times q$ blocks where the
$(i,j)$ block is $a_{ij}B$.  Then the result for Hadamard matrices is
as follows:
\begin{theorem}
  The Kronecker product of a Hadamard matrix is a Hadamard matrix.
  \begin{proof}
    The subsequent proof is from Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques,
    Algorithms by Cameron\cite{cameron1}. The following
    properties of Kronecker products will be utilized in the proof:
    $(A\otimes B) (B\otimes C)= AC\otimes CD$ and $(A\otimes B)^{T}=
    A^{T} \otimes B^{T}$. 

    Suppose there exist two Hadamard matrices, $H_{1}$, which is of
    order $n_{1}$, and $H_{2}$, which is of order $n_{2}$. Then taking
    the Kronecker product of these, we get $H_{1}\otimes H_{2}$, which
    is of size $n_{1}n_{2}$.  In order to be a Hadamard matrix, this
    new matrix must have the property $(H_{1}\otimes
    H_{2})(H_{1}\otimes H_{2})^{T}= n_{1}n_{2}I_{n_{1}n_{2}}$. Looking
    at $(H_{1}\otimes H_{2})(H_{1}\otimes H_{2})^{T}$ and using the
    above properties of Kronecker products, we get:
    \begin{align*}
      (H_{1}\otimes H_{2})(H_{1}\otimes H_{2})^{T} &= (H_{1}\otimes
      H_{2})(H_{1}^{T}\otimes H_{2}^{T})\\
      &= (H_{1}H_{1}^{T}\otimes H_{2}H_{2}^{T})\\
      &= n_{1} I_{n_{1}}\otimes n_{2}I_{n_{2}}= n_{1}n_{2}I_{n_{1}}I_{n_{2}}
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $H_{1}\otimes H_{2}$ is a Hadamard matrix.\cite{cameron1}
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
By starting with the Hadamard matrix $(-1$) and repeatedly taking the Kronecker product of the previous result with the Hadamard matrix $
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 1\\
  1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}$, one obtains the Hadamard matrices shown in \autoref{fig:3xsly}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{had4}
  \includegraphics{had8}
  \includegraphics{had16-syl}
  \caption{Hadamard matrices were obtained by beginning with the
    matrix $[-1]$ and concurrently taking the Kronecker product with
    the matrix two, three and fourtimes, respectively. [8]}
  \label{fig:3xsly}
\end{figure}\todo{Hadamard matrix noch einbauen}

In this way, it would be possible to obtain a Hadamard matrix of order
$2^{m}$ for all non-negative integers $m$.  Any Hadamard matrix
obtained in this way is said to be of the Sylvester
type.\cite{cameron1}

Raymond E.\,A.\,C.\,Paley found a second construction for Hadamard
matrices in 1933.  His construction yields Hadamard matrices of the
size $q+1$, where $q=p^{r}\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.  In order to derive his
result, several definitions and theorems need to be given.  This
derivation of Paley’s result comes from Designs and Their Codes By
Assmus and Key\cite{assmus}. The proofs will be omitted
here, but they can be found in Designs and Their Codes.

Firstly, Paley’s theorem depends on quadratic residues of $\F_{4}$.
Quadratic residues are the elements $f\in\F_{4}$ that have a solution
$g\in\F_{4}$ to the equation $f=g^{2}$.

\begin{theorem}
  If $q=p^{r}$, where $p$ is an odd prime, then exactly half of the
  non-zero elements of $\F_{4}$ are squares.  Moreover, $-1$ is a
  square if and only if $q\equiv 1\pmod{4}$.
\end{theorem}
Next, it is necessary to define the Legendre symbol, which is a
character of the multiplicative group of $\F_{4}$.
\begin{definition}
   If $q$ is a power of an odd prime, then $c$, the Legendre symbol,
   defines the following mapping:
   \begin{align*}
     \chi&\colon\F_{4}\rightarrow (0,1,-1)\\
     \chi(x) &=
     \begin{cases}
       0 & x=0\\
       1 & x \text{is a non-zero}\\
       -1 & x \text{is a non-square}
     \end{cases}
   \end{align*}
\end{definition}
Using this mapping, it is possible to define a $q\times q$ matrix $Q=
(q_{ij})$, called the Jacobsthal matrix, whose row and column labels
are the elements of $\F_{4}$ and whose elements are $q=\chi (y-x)$.

Using the matrix $Q$ defined above,the following is Paley’s
construction:
\begin{theorem}
  If $q\equiv 3\pmod{4}$ and $Q$ is the Jacobsthal matrix for $\F_{4}$, then $H=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & j\\
    j^{t} & Q
  \end{pmatrix}$
  is a Hadamard matrix of size q+1.\cite{assmus}
\end{theorem}
Paley also found two other existence theorems for Hadamard matrices
that appear in his 1933 paper.\cite{tressler}  They are as
follows:
\begin{theorem}
  Let $m$ be divisible by $4$ and of the form $2^{k} (p^{k}+1)$, where
  $p$ is an odd prime. Then we can construct a Hadamard matrix of
  order $m$.\cite{tressler}
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
  Let $m$ be divisible by $4$ and of the form $2^{k}p(p^{k} +
  1)$,\todo{Ausdruck prüfen} where $q\equiv 3\pmod{4}$ is prime. Then
  we can construct a Hadamard matrix of order
  $m$.\cite{tressler}
\end{theorem}

When this result is combined with the Kronecker product, many Hadamard
matrices of orders previously unknown to exist can be found.  This
construction can find Hadamard matrices for all orders $n=4m$ up to $n
= 92$.\cite{tressler}

Williamson developed another construction for Hadamard matrices in
1944.  His construction is shown in the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  Suppose there exists $n\times n$ matrices $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ with
  the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ are symmetric matrices having entries $\pm1$.
  \item The matrices $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ commute.
  \item $A^{2}+B^{2}+C^{2}+D^{2}= 4nI_{n}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Then there exist a Hadamard matrix of order $4n$ given by:
\begin{gather*}
  H =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    A & B & C & D\\
    -B & A & D & -C\\
    -C & -D & A & B\\
    -D & C & -B & A
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{gather*}
This construction was used to find a Hadamard matrix of order 92,
which up until 1944 was the smallest factor of four without a known
Hadamard matrix.\cite{tressler}

\section{Codes Utilizing Hadamard Matrices}
\label{sec:codehm}

Coding theory is inspirited by the need to reliably transmit
information across a noisy channel.  In general, a code is simply a
collection of codewords to whom some meaning has been assigned.  Often
in coding, one is looking for a set of codewords that are dissimilar
or, in other words, have a large Hamming distance from one another.
The Hamming distance of two codewords is the number of places in which
the two words differ. The larger the Hamming distance, the easier it
is to detect and correct errors in a message, especially if the code
contains several errors.

Looking at the rows of a Hadamard matrix, it is evident that the
Hamming distance between any two rows is $\sfrac{n}{2}$.  This is true
since the rows are orthogonal to each other. This implies that half
the pairs must have a product of one (meaning the elements multiplied
were either $1$ and $1$ or $-1$ and $-1$) and half the pairs must have
a product of $-1$ (meaning one member of the pair was $-1$ and the
other $1$).  Thus, half of the entries of any one row are different
from the entries of any other row and the Hamming distance between the
rows is always $\sfrac{n}{2}$.  Therefore, as many as $\sfrac{n}{2}-1$
errors can be made in the transmission of a codeword and that codeword
can still be translated correctly.

Within coding, binary codes are often desirable. Any Hadamard matrix
can be turned into a binary matrix by changing all $-1$ into zeros.  By
doing so, the codewords become binary and the hamming distance between
words is preserved.

A Hadamard code is a code developed by taking each row a Hadamard
matrix as a codeword.  It is also possible to develop a shortened
Hadamard code.  To do so, one must first normalize a Hadamard matrix
so that the first column is made entirely of ones.  Then each codeword
can drop the leading one, thus constructing a code of length $n-1$ and
still having hamming distance
$\sfrac{n}{2}$.\cite{hallj}

Another class of codes that is closely related to Hadamard matrices
are the Reed-Muller codes.  I.\,S.\,Reed and D.\,E.\,Muller developed
these codes independently of one another in 1954.  This is a class of
binary codes of length $2^{m}$, for any positive integer $m$.  More
specifically, the Reed-Muller code $RM(1,m)^{\pm}$ is associated with
the Hadamard matrices of the Sylvester type.\cite{hallj}

Another desirable property of Hadamard codes and Reed-Muller codes is
the ability to decode the musing the Fast Hadamard transform.  This
decoding algorithm allows codes to be transformed much more
efficiently than they otherwise would have been.  For example, the
Reed-Muller code $RM(1,3)^{\pm}$ can be achieved in thirty-one steps,
rather than by as many as sixty-three steps using other
algorithms.\cite{hallj}

\section{Designs from Hadamard Matrices}
\label{sec:designs}

Designs are an important area for many reasons, most importantly in
statistics and design of experiments.  A $t-(v,k,\lambda)$ design is a
pair $(X,B)$ where $X$ is a set of $v$ points and $B$ is a collection
of $k$-subsets of $X$, called blocks, with the property that any $t$
points are contained in exactly $\lambda$ blocks.  In order to have a
non-trivial design the following conditions must occur: $t<k<v$ and
$\lambda>0$.\cite{cameron1}

Scientists need to know whether a design with certain parameters
actually exists.  Therefore, it is important to have constrictions for
designs if such a design is needed.  One example of a class of designs
are the Hadamard designs. It is possible to construct a Hadamard
design given a Hadamard matrix.  For this reason, the existence of
Hadamard matrices for all orders $n = 4m$ becomes even more important
since the existence of a Hadamard matrix implies the existence of a
design as well.  The following theorem details the connection between
Hadamard matrices and their designs.

\begin{theorem}\label{theo:10}
  For $n>4$, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There exists a Hadamard matrix of order $n$.
  \item There exists a $3- (n,\sfrac{1}{2}n, \sfrac{1}{4}n-1)$ design.
  \item There exists a $2- (n-1, \sfrac{1}{2}n-1, \sfrac{1}{4}n-1)$ design.\cite{cameron1}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Before proving this theorem, it is necessary to prove the following
theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{theo:11}
  If $H$ is an Hadamard matrix with $m > 1$, then $n$ is even and for
  any two distinct rows of $H$ there are precisely $\sfrac{n}{2}$
  columns in which the entries of the two rows agree.  Further, if $n
  > 2$, then $n$ is divisible by $4$ and for any three distinct rows
  of $H$ there are precisely $\sfrac{n}{4}$ columns in which the
  entries in all three rows agree.  The same statements hold for the
  columns of $H$.\cite{assmus}
  \begin{proof}
    The first statement of \autoref{theo:11} is true because the rows
    are orthogonal. The argument for proving this statement is
    synonymous with the argument used to show the Hamming distance
    between the rows is $\sfrac{n}{2}$.  For the second part of the
    theorem, the proof comes from Designs and Their Codes by Assmus and
    Key.\cite{assmus} Suppose $n >2$.  Then $n$ is divisible
    by four and could be written as $n = 2r$.  Therefore, any two rows
    of $H$ agree in exactly $r$ places.  Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ be three
    distinct rows of $H$.  Let $A$ be the set of columns in which rows
    $x$ and $y$ agree and $D$ be the set of columns in which $x$ and
    $y$ differ.  The size of both $A$ and $D$ must be $r$.  Now
    looking at row $z$, let $A'$ be the columns in $A$ in which $z$
    and $x$ agree and let $D'$ be the columns in $D$ in which $x$ and
    $z$ agree. Thus the total number of places $x$ and $z$ agree is
    $A'+D'$ and, as a result, $A' + D' = r$.  Now looking at row $y$,
    the columns in $A$ in which $y$ and $z$ agree is also $A'$ and the
    columns in $D$ in which $y$ and $z$ agree are the compliment of
    those in $D’$. Therefore, the number of columns in which $y$ and
    $z$ agree is $A' + D-D'$, which also must equal $r$.

    Thus, one could set $A' + D'= A' + D -D'$ and solve to get $D'=
    \sfrac{r}{2}$ and, substituting this back into $A' + D'= r$, one
    would get $A' = \sfrac{r}{2}$.  Since the columns in $A'$ are the
    only columns in which all three rows agree, then the total number
    of places any set of three columns agree is $\sfrac{m}{4}$.  This
    theorem is true for the columns of a Hadamard matrix since the
    transpose of a Hadamard matrix is also a Hadamard
    matrix.\cite{assmus}
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Using this information, it is possible to prove \autoref{theo:10}.
  The following is a proof from Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques,
  Algorithms by Cameron\cite{cameron1}. First, it is necessary
  to prove (i) implies (ii). Let $H= (h_{ij})$ be a Hadamard matrix of
  order $n$.  Normalize the matrix so that the entire first row is
  made of ones. For each row after the first, let $B_{i}^{+}= \Set{j |
    h_{ij}=+1}$ and let $B_{i}^{-}= \Set{j | h_{ij}=-1}$.  Also, let
  $X=\Set{1,2,\dots,n}$ and $B= \Set{B_{i}^{+}, B_{i}^{-} |
    i=2,3,\dots,n}$.  By \autoref{theo:11}, every row must match every
  other row in half the columns and differ in the other half of the
  columns.  Since the first row is made entirely of ones, then every
  other row must contain $\sfrac{n}{2}$ ones and $\sfrac{n}{2}$
  negative ones.  Thus, each block contains $\sfrac{n}{2}$ points as
  desired.  Also by \autoref{theo:11}, any three rows match in exactly
  $\sfrac{n}{4}$ columns.  Similarly, any three columns must match in
  exactly $\sfrac{n}{4}$ rows.  Since all the columns match in the
  first row, which was not used to create blocks, then each set of
  three columns meet on exactly $\sfrac{n}{4}-1$ of the sets in $B$.
  Thus, $(X,B)$ is a $3 - (n, \sfrac{1}{2}n, \sfrac{1}{4}n - 1)$
  design.

  Now, to show (ii) implies (iii), one can take the derived design
  with respect to one point, meaning that one point $p$ is deleted
  from all blocks and any blocks not incident to that point are also
  deleted. The result is a $2- (n-1, \sfrac{1}{2}n –1, \sfrac{1}{4}n –
  1)$ design.

  Now, in order to finish the proof of \autoref{theo:10}, (iii) must
  imply (i).  Suppose there exist a $2- (n-1, \sfrac{1}{2}n-1,
  \sfrac{1}{4}n- 1)$ design called $D$. Let $A$ be the incidence
  matrix of $D$.  First, replace all the zero entries of $A$ with
  negative ones and then border $A$ with a row and column of ones.
  The resulting matrix will be called $H$.  In $A$, any row had
  $\sfrac{n}{2}-1$ ones.  Thus, any row of $H$ after the first row of
  ones agrees with first row in exactly $\sfrac{n}{2}$ columns.  Now
  looking at any two rows of $A$, these rows both have ones in
  $\sfrac{n}{4}-1$ places and they both have zeros in $\sfrac{n}{4}$
  places.  This is a result of the complement of $D$ being a $2- (n-1,
  \sfrac{1}{2} n, \sfrac{1}{4}n)$ design.  Therefore, the
  corresponding rows in $H$ agree in exactly $\sfrac{n}{2}$ places.
  Therefore, any two rows on $H$ agree in exactly $\sfrac{n}{2}$
  places.  As a result, $H$ is a Hadamard
  matrix.\cite{cameron1}
\end{proof}

\section{Other Applications of Hadamard Matrices}
\label{sec:other}

Several other uses of Hadamard matrices exist besides those in coding
theory and the creation of designs.  One such use is in the creation
of weighing plans.  Weighing plans are used in experiments where the
measure of a set of objects is represented as the sum of the measures
of each object in the set. This is useful because, by weighing a group
of objects, one can more accurately determine the individual
measurements since any error in measurement will be spread across more
objects.\cite{agaian} Hadamard matrices can also be used in graph theory to
construct strongly regular graphs as well as tournaments.\cite{agaian} Also,
some Hadamard matrices are equivalent to Walsh functions, which are
important in many engineering applications.\cite{wallis} Overall, Hadamard
matrices can be an extremely useful tool to both scientists and
mathematicians. There is still much left to be discovered, however,
about this class of matrices.
